# üöÄ GitHub Setup for FlowLogic Route

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/Jake1848
2. Click "New repository" (green button)
3. Repository name: `flowlogic-route`
4. Description: `Professional route optimization platform for delivery and logistics`
5. Make it **Public** (so Render can access it for free)
6. ‚úÖ Add README file
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repo, run these commands:

```bash
# Remove the old remote (if it exists)
git remote remove origin

# Add the correct remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Jake1848/flowlogic-route.git

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

If you get authentication errors, use your GitHub personal access token:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/Jake1848/flowlogic-route.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

Go to https://github.com/Jake1848/flowlogic-route and verify you see:
- ‚úÖ All your project files
- ‚úÖ frontend/ folder with React code
- ‚úÖ docker/ folder with deployment files
- ‚úÖ README.md, requirements.txt, etc.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Reminder

After setup, regenerate your GitHub token:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Delete the current token
3. Create a new one for future use

Your code is ready for Render deployment once it's on GitHub! üöÄ
