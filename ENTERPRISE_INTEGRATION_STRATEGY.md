## Technical Implementation

### API Gateway Architecture
```python
# New enterprise integration service
@app.post("/enterprise/integrate/{platform}")
async def enterprise_integration(platform: str, data: dict):
    if platform == "descartes":
        return await sync_with_descartes(data)
    elif platform == "sap_tm":
        return await sync_with_sap_tm(data)
    elif platform == "oracle_otm":
        return await sync_with_oracle_otm(data)
    elif platform == "manhattan":
        return await sync_with_manhattan(data)
```

### Data Mapping Layer

## Competitive Positioning

**"AI-Native Route Optimization for the Modern Enterprise"**

- **vs Descartes**: Faster, cheaper, more intelligent
- **vs SAP**: No vendor lock-in, rapid deployment
- **vs Oracle**: Modern UI/UX, API-first architecture
- **vs Manhattan**: Cost-effective, easy integration

This positions FlowLogic as the "intelligent middleware" that enhances existing enterprise systems rather than replacing them entirely.
