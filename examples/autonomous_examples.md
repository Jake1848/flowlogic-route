# FlowLogic RouteAI - Autonomous Examples

## ðŸ¤– Autonomous Routing (`/route/auto`)

The `/route/auto` endpoint accepts just a list of addresses and optional constraints, then automatically:
- Parses addresses using AI
- Estimates pallets, time windows, and special handling requirements
- Generates an optimal truck fleet
- Routes everything autonomously

### Example 1: Basic Autonomous Routing

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/route/auto" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "addresses": "123 Walmart Supercenter, Atlanta GA\n456 Home Depot, Marietta GA\n789 Kroger Store, Decatur GA\n321 McDonald'\''s Restaurant, Buckhead GA\n654 Children'\''s Hospital, Atlanta GA",
    "constraints": "Deliver frozen goods first and avoid downtown during rush hour"
  }'
```

**AI Will Automatically:**
- Parse 5 addresses from the text
- Estimate Walmart: 6 pallets, business hours window
- Estimate Home Depot: 8 pallets, heavy goods, morning preferred  
- Estimate Kroger: 4 pallets, refrigerated goods, early delivery
- Estimate McDonald's: 3 pallets, frozen goods, 6AM-11AM window
- Estimate Hospital: 2 pallets, fragile medical supplies
- Generate 2-3 trucks: Dry, Refrigerated, and possibly Heavy/Flatbed
- Apply rush hour avoidance (7-9AM, 5-7PM)
- Prioritize frozen deliveries first

### Example 2: Simple Address List

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/route/auto" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "addresses": "1. 100 Peachtree St, Atlanta GA\n2. 200 North Ave, Atlanta GA\n3. 300 Spring St, Atlanta GA\n4. 400 Marietta St, Atlanta GA",
    "constraints": "Keep routes under 100 miles"
  }'
```

### Example 3: Mixed Business Types

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/route/auto" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "addresses": "Target Store - 500 Commerce Dr, Atlanta GA; Pharmacy Plus - 600 Medical Blvd, Roswell GA; Heavy Equipment Co - 700 Industrial Way, Marietta GA; Fresh Market - 800 Organic Ave, Decatur GA",
    "constraints": "Morning deliveries only and handle fragile items carefully"
  }'
```

**Expected AI Behavior:**
- Target: 6 pallets, standard goods, business hours
- Pharmacy: 2 pallets, fragile medical, restricted access
- Heavy Equipment: 12 pallets, heavy machinery, flatbed required
- Fresh Market: 4 pallets, refrigerated, morning delivery preferred
- Generate specialized fleet: Dry, Refrigerated, Flatbed trucks
- All deliveries scheduled before noon

## ðŸ”„ Live Re-Routing (`/route/recalculate`)

Dynamic re-routing for real-time changes: stop cancellations, delays, new urgent deliveries.

### Example 1: Cancel a Stop

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/route/recalculate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "original_routes": [/* previous routing response */],
    "stops": [/* original stops */],
    "trucks": [/* original trucks */],
    "changes": {
      "cancel_stop": {
        "stop_id": 3
      }
    },
    "reason": "Customer requested cancellation - store closed"
  }'
```

### Example 2: Add Urgent Delivery

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/route/recalculate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "original_routes": [/* previous routing response */],
    "stops": [/* original stops */],
    "trucks": [/* original trucks */],
    "changes": {
      "add_stop": {
        "stop_id": 99,
        "address": "Emergency Medical Center, 900 Urgent Care Blvd, Atlanta GA",
        "pallets": 1,
        "special_constraint": "Fragile"
      }
    },
    "reason": "Urgent medical delivery requested"
  }'
```

### Example 3: Handle Delay

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/route/recalculate" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "original_routes": [/* previous routing response */],
    "stops": [/* original stops */],
    "trucks": [/* original trucks */],
    "changes": {
      "delay_stop": {
        "stop_id": 5,
        "new_time_window": "14:00-18:00"
      }
    },
    "reason": "Customer requested afternoon delivery due to staffing issues"
  }'
```

## ðŸ§  Advanced Natural Language Constraints

The AI understands complex routing instructions:

### Traffic & Geography
- "Avoid I-285 during rush hour"
- "Skip downtown Atlanta from 4-6 PM"
- "Use surface streets only"
- "Avoid toll roads"

### Time & Scheduling  
- "All deliveries before noon"
- "Morning routes only"
- "Stagger deliveries every 30 minutes"
- "Complete by 3 PM to avoid school traffic"

### Load & Capacity
- "Keep routes under 150 miles"
- "Maximum 8 stops per truck"
- "Fill trucks to 90% capacity"
- "Balance loads evenly"

### Special Handling
- "Frozen goods go first"
- "Load fragile items last for easy access"
- "Refrigerated and frozen on same truck"
- "Separate hazmat from food deliveries"

### Efficiency Goals
- "Minimize fuel costs"
- "Reduce total driving time"
- "Optimize for driver overtime"
- "Consolidate routes where possible"
